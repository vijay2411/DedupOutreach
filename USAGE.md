# DedupManager — Setup & Usage

Two pieces: a **Google Sheet + Apps Script backend**, and a **Chrome extension**.
The technical person runs the backend deploy once; teammates paste one config
string into the extension.

---

## Part 1 — Backend (the technical person, once)

### Fast path: `./deploy.sh` (recommended)

```bash
npm i -g @google/clasp     # install Google's Apps Script CLI
clasp login                # opens your browser; authorize once
# one-time: enable the Apps Script API at
#   https://script.google.com/home/usersettings  (toggle "Apps Script API" on)
./deploy.sh                # creates the Sheet + script, pushes, deploys
```

`deploy.sh` will:
- generate a random **team API key** into `apps-script/Config.gs` (gitignored),
- create a new Google Sheet with a bound script,
- push the code and deploy it as a public-URL web app **that runs as you**
  (no manual click-through),
- pin a **stable deployment URL** (re-running `./deploy.sh` after code changes
  keeps the same URL — teammates never re-import),
- print the **dashboard URL**, the **API key**, and a **shareable config string**.

Open the printed dashboard URL once to initialize the Sheet tabs. Edit the
`TEAM_JSON` line in `deploy.sh` (and the `TEAM` array in `apps-script/Index.html`)
to your real names.

> "Access: anyone" sounds scary — the **API key gates every data call**, so only
> the dashboard *page* is reachable by URL, and it's useless without the key.

### Manual path (no clasp)

1. [sheets.new](https://sheets.new) → name it → **Extensions → Apps Script**.
2. Recreate two files (consolidated — just two now):
   - `Code.gs` ← paste `apps-script/Code.gs`
   - `Index.html` (➕ New → HTML) ← paste `apps-script/Index.html`
3. Add a `Config.gs` (➕ New → Script) with `var TEAM_API_KEY = '<long random>';`
   (see `apps-script/Config.example.gs`).
4. **Deploy → New deployment → Web app** → *Execute as:* **Me**,
   *Who has access:* **Anyone** → copy the `/exec` URL.
5. Open the `/exec` URL once to initialize tabs.

> Redeploying manually: **Deploy → Manage deployments → edit → Version: New
> version**, or the old code keeps serving.

---

## Part 2 — Chrome extension (each teammate)

1. `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked** →
   select the `extension/` folder.
2. Click the DedupManager icon → **Connection settings** →
   paste the **config string** the host shared → **Import config**.
   (This sets the URL, key, and team names in one shot.)
3. Pick **I am → your name**. Leave **Active mode** on. Done.

> The host gets their own config string from `./deploy.sh` output, or from the
> popup: set URL + key manually once, then **Copy shareable config** to hand to
> the others.

## The data model (one row per person)

Each person is **one row** with managed columns:
`id, name, company, phone, linkedin, email, reddit, status, added_by, added_at,
updated_at, updated_by, notes`.

You can reach a person by phone, LinkedIn, **or** email — each is matched
independently, so any single shared identifier links to the same record.

### Add your own CRM columns
Add any columns you like in the Sheet (e.g. `stage_detail`, `call_date`,
`insight`, `next_step`). The app **never reorders or overwrites them** — it only
writes the managed columns above. Your columns show **read-only** in the
dashboard's **People** tab (amber headers); edit them directly in the Sheet.

### How merging works (important)
On save the app **upserts**: if the person already exists under any identifier,
it merges — filling blank identifiers, updating status, appending notes, keeping
the original `added_by` and recording `updated_by`. Two records merge **only when
they share an identifier** (or **Fuzzy name + company** is on). Log someone by
LinkedIn and a teammate has only their email? They stay separate until a shared
identifier links them — or turn on fuzzy matching to also merge on name+company.

## Daily use

- **On LinkedIn / Reddit / Gmail**: a badge appears bottom-right —
  🟢 *not in CRM* or 🔴 *already in CRM (owner · matched-on · stage)*. Click
  **Log this person / View · update record**, verify the prefilled fields, set a
  **stage**, **Save** (merges if they exist).
- **Anywhere else**: open the dashboard → **Check & Add**, fill name / phone /
  LinkedIn / email, **Check for duplicates**, then **Save**.
- **Browse / search people**: dashboard → **People** tab (shows custom columns too).
- **Tune strictness & stages**: dashboard → **Settings** (syncs to everyone's
  extension within a few minutes).

## Tuning (Settings tab)

| Setting | Notes |
|---|---|
| Stages | comma-separated; first is the default for new people |
| Phone: ignore country code | compare last 10 digits (default on) |
| Ignore `+tags` in email | `you+lead@x.com` → `you@x.com` |
| Ignore dots in email | Gmail-style `j.a.ne@gmail` → `jane@gmail` |
| LinkedIn slug only | match `/in/<slug>`, ignore url params (default on) |
| Normalize Reddit handles | strip `u/`, `/user/`, lowercase (default on) |
| Fuzzy name + company | also merge same name+company without a shared identifier |
| Fuzzy threshold | lower = looser, higher = stricter |

## Tests

```bash
node extension/matcher.test.js   # matching engine: normalization, multi-identifier match, fuzzy
node apps-script/upsert.test.js  # merge: blank-fill, owner preservation, custom-column survival
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `clasp push` mentions the API | Enable it once: https://script.google.com/home/usersettings |
| `Not logged in to clasp` | Run `clasp login`. |
| Badge says "set your name" | Open popup → pick your name. |
| Badge never appears | Popup should show "synced N contacts"; re-import config; toggle Active mode. |
| "unauthorized" on save | Extension key ≠ `TEAM_API_KEY` in `Config.gs`; re-import the latest config. |
| A scraped name/company is wrong | Edit it in the confirm card before saving — extraction is best-effort by design. |
| Want a fresh deployment URL | Delete `.deployment-id` and re-run `./deploy.sh`. |
